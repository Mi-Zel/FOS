## Description

We tried to make a food ordering service website. It would be made for companies where people need to order food for lunch and it’s taking them a lot of time. This is a solution to make it easier. Advantage of it will be that our website could use many companies. We wanted to make a register and login system so it would be possible.
We wanted to make the ordering clear. Make databases to remember which food is more and most ordered and when ordering this food wil be automatically be on top so you can choose easilly.
